# NES-Emulator
A personal project where I take on the task of creating a NES emulator in C++. Currently doesn't boot any games, but can read and execute simple math programs written in assembly/hex. 
Inspired and based on this project (https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES) &amp; tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8kx56OZQhg)
